This is a simple Monk aura module for the [ShotGlass raid frames](http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/shotglass-raid-frames/). You must have that mod installed and enabled for this to do anything.

Left dot: Life Cocoon, Soothing Mist.  
Middle dot: Renewing Mist.  
Left dot: Enveloping Mist.

A somewhat out-of-date list of raid debuffs is shown. I haven't raid-healed seriously since T13 so I don't know what the trendy list of debuffs to show is.
