This is a simple Monk aura module for the [ShotGlass raid frames](http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/shotglass-raid-frames/). You must have that mod installed and enabled for this to do anything.

Left dot: [Life Cocoon](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=116849), [Soothing Mist](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=125953).  
Middle dot: [Renewing Mist](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=119611).  
Right dot: [Enveloping Mist](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=132120).

A somewhat out-of-date list of raid debuffs is shown. I haven't raid-healed seriously since T13 so I don't know what the trendy list of debuffs to show is.
